# Spells Documentation Hub

This folder collects any extended spell authoring guides that sit outside the per-subsystem references (e.g., DSL specs, JSON schemas, and long-form examples). Keep Markdown pages here if they support content tooling, and link to them from `Framework/Docs/Subsystems/Spells.md` so the main index stays accurate.

Current pages:

- `Examples.md` – curated spell definitions and JSON snippets.
